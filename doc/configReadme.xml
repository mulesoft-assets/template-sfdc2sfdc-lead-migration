As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize leads between two Salesforce orgs.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating leads from one Salesforce instance to another, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behavior when a lead already exists in the destination org. 

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).

The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

Migration process starts from fetching all the existing Leads that match the filter criteria from Salesforce Org A.
On *Process* stage matched leads will be grouped and inserted or updated in Salesforce Org B.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcleadsync` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdcleadsync.cloudhub.io/syncleads` and report will be sent to the e-mails configured.

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. The application will poll SalesForce to know if there are any newly created or updated objects and synchronize them.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / {page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Leads to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***{page.size}*** is because, by default, Leads are gathered in groups of {page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Anypoint Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

###  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `syncleads` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Leads migrated and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of executing the logic.
For the purpose of this particular Anypoint Template the *mainFlow* just executes the Batch Job which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Exception Handling that basically consists on invoking the *errorHandlingFlow* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
